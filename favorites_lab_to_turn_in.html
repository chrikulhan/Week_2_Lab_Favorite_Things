<h1>Some of my favorite things:</h1>

<p>One of my favorite documentaries is about a (then) 93 year old icon named Iris Apfel. She started a
textile company with her husband and worked with 9 presidential administrations updating various White House
furniture. Her bold use of color, accessory quantity and size, and her quirky personality made her a fashion model
  in her 90s. Her 101st birthday was on August 29th, 2022.</p>
