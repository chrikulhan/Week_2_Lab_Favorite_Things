  <h2>Favorite Movie</h2>
  <p>One of my favorite documentaries is about a (then) 93 year old icon named Iris Apfel. She started a
  textile company with her husband and worked with 9 presidential administrations updating various White House
  furniture. Her bold use of color, accessory quantity and size, and her quirky personality made her a fashion model
    in her 90s. Her 101st birthday was on August 29th, 2022.</p>

Wikipedia page about the movie.</a>
the name of the movie should be in italics <i>Name of movie</i> -->

  <h2>Favorite Musical Artist</h2>
  <p>My current favorite musician is <b><span id="favorite-music-name">Jon Baptiste</span></b>. He was in a band on <i>The Late Show, with Stephen Colbert</i>, but after
